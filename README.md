With its intuitive interface and seamless integration, KPMG-CodeSecGPT empowers you to write more secure code and streamline your development workflow.

## Features

* **AI-powered vulnerability detection:** KPMG-CodeSecGPT analyzes your code using GPT-3.5-Turbo, pinpointing potential security issues based on its vast knowledge of code patterns and common vulnerabilities.
  
* **Actionable suggestions:** KPMG-CodeSecGPT doesn't just highlight vulnerabilities; it provides tailored suggestions for fixing them, guiding you towards more secure coding practices.
  
* **Seamless integration:** KPMG-CodeSecGPT works directly within your VSCode environment, offering real-time feedback as you code.
  
* **Customization options:** You can fine-tune the extension's behavior to match your specific coding style and preferences.
  
* **Change logging:** All code modifications suggested by KPMG-CodeSecGPT and applied by the user are automatically logged for traceability and audit purposes.

## Requirements

* **Visual Studio Code:** Ensure you have the latest version of VSCode installed.
* **OpenAI API access:** You'll need an OpenAI API key to enable communication with the GPT-3.5-Turbo model.

## Installation

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js, npm, and TypeScript installed on your system.
* Change the OpenAI API Keys to your own in the source code.
* Visual Studio Code or Visual Studio Code Insider on system.

**Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riftsandroses/KPMG-CodeSecGPT
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd KPMG-CodeSecGPT
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Build the VSIX package:**

   ```bash
   tsc -p . && vsce package
   ```

   This will create a VSIX file in the `dist` folder.

5. **Install the VSIX package:**

      - Open the VSCode Extensions view (**Ctrl+Shift+X** or **Cmd+Shift+X** on macOS).
      - Click the three dots (...) in the top right corner and select "Install from VSIX...".
      - Select the VSIX file you created in step 4.

## Known Issues

 **Accuracy may vary:** While GPT-3.5-Turbo is highly advanced, it's still under development, and its accuracy in detecting vulnerabilities can vary depending on several factors, including:
- Code complexity: The model may struggle with highly complex or obfuscated code, potentially leading to missed vulnerabilities or false positives.
- Data availability: The model's training data plays a significant role in its performance. If the training data lacked specific vulnerabilities or coding styles, the model might be less effective in detecting them.
- Temperature setting: The temperature parameter in GPT-3.5-Turbo controls the randomness of its outputs. Higher temperatures can lead to more creative and diverse suggestions, but also potentially increase the risk of inaccurate or irrelevant recommendations. It's crucial to experiment and find the optimal temperature setting for your specific needs and codebase.
